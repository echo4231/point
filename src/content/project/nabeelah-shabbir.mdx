      ## Shining a light on invisible harassment: The perspective of
      fact-checkers and women journalists


      The final panel of the POINT 1011 Conference focused on online and visible harassment female journalists and fact-checkers face daily, the influence of public figures on harassment and enabling narratives. 


      The panel focused on the discussion between four female media workers: Jennifer Adams (Pen to Paper), Nabeelah Shabbir (International Center for Journalists),  Milanka Kovačević (Direkt Portal) and  Ana Brakus (Faktograf), while being moderated by Tijana Cvjetićanin (UG “Zašto ne” – CA “Why not” ).

## Nabeelah Shabbir is a British-Pakistani freelance journalist, based in Amsterdam.

As Senior Research Associate at the Washington DC-based International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), Nabeelah collaborates with a small team of women investigating topics such as: disinformation in newsrooms around the world; journalism after the pandemic; and online violence against women journalists.

She is co-author of a series of reports at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford about digital-born news media; innovation in news media in the Global South; and the impact of the Panama Papers investigation, three years on.

At The Guardian, Nabeelah shared a British Journalism Award with the “Keep it in the Ground” team, which focused its reporting on fossil fuel divestment and climate change, in 2015. She was also a “European Young Journalist” of the year for her writing in Kosovo in 2008.
