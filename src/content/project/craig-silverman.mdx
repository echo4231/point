      ## Shining a light on invisible harassment: The perspective of
      fact-checkers and women journalists


      The final panel of the POINT 1011 Conference focused on online and visible harassment female journalists and fact-checkers face daily, the influence of public figures on harassment and enabling narratives. 


      The panel focused on the discussion between four female media workers: Jennifer Adams (Pen to Paper), Nabeelah Shabbir (International Center for Journalists),  Milanka Kovačević (Direkt Portal) and  Ana Brakus (Faktograf), while being moderated by Tijana Cvjetićanin (UG “Zašto ne” – CA “Why not” ).
